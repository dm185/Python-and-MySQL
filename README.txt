For this project, I decided to figure out how to run MySQL queries on a Jupyter Notebook. These projects can and may 
be used as a tutorial or as a guide. Since this is the first part in a series of projects involving running queries on a Jupyter Notebook, 
the queries will be relatively basic. In each subsequent project, the queries will get more complex. The data used in these projects will
be fictional unless noted. The main goal for this project is to get practice with creating a table and inserting data into it. Once
the data is inserted, a series of queries will be executed filtering the data as desired. For this project and the next one, the same
table will be used. Once I get into joins, two or more new tables will be created.
